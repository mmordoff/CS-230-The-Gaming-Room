# CS-230-The-Gaming-Room

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

A client, The Gaming Room, was looking to create a web-based version of their gaming application “Draw It or Lose It”. The web application had to have multiple teams and players, unique names, and only allow a single instance of the game to exist in memory.  The web-based version had to have a large library stock of drawings to use as clues for 30 seconds each round, contain four one-minute rounds, and allow the opposing team 15 seconds to guess a clue if the team guessed incorrectly.


What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I wrote a comprehensive software design, UML diagram, and thorough explanations to help assist in the development of the code. 


What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

I found the UML diagram the most helpful due to it bridging together the development of the code and the design document. It allowed me to understand the structure and allowed the development of classes.


If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would revise the evaluation section. I would introduce a cloud platform server as an option as well as compare the different web browsers to determine what would produce the best platform for the game.


How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

It is important to anticipate the user’s needs when designing software. If the user is frustrated or confused, the user will not use the product. It is vital to design a product or software that is user-friendly.


How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

The first approach is to understand what the requirements are or what the desired outcome is of the software. Next, start vague and work towards being more specific. Map out classes and create a UML diagram. This will create a more efficient and effective way to design software.
